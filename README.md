# Concrete Strength Predictor

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the factors contributing to high-performance concrete strength. Using data science techniques and machine learning models, we investigate how different components—such as cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, and aggregate—affect the final compressive strength of concrete.

The goal is to understand the complex relationships between mix design variables and resulting durability, which is critical for civil and industrial engineering applications.
